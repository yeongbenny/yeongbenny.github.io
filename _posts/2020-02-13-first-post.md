My task during People Space Bad Print’s project was to create a frontend plugin that works on top of OctoPrint. 
Our plugin’s final purpose is to execute video analysis via communication through the machine learning server and manufacture the JSON result into a visualize gauge model to show the status of a 3d printer in real time. 
We chose to add other options such as giving direct email notice when spaghetti happens and a ‘STOP’ button that can actually stop the 3d printer remotely.
